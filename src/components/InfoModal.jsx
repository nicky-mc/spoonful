              Spoon Theory was developed by Christine Miserandino as a way to explain the energy limitations experienced by people with chronic illnesses. It is also widely adopted by the neurodivergent (ND) community to describe how energy, focus, and mental capacity can vary throughout the day.

                Spoons are a metaphor for energy. Everyone starts their day with a certain number of spoons, representing their available energy. For neurotypical (NT) individuals, spoons may replenish more easily, and tasks may require fewer spoons. For neurodivergent (ND) individuals, everyday tasks can consume a significantly higher number of spoons.
